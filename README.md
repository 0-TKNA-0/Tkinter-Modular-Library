This is a modular library that I intend on expanding upon as I learn more about tkinter and its modules.

This modular library serves as a place to come to for inspiration when wanting to add functionality to a project.
It acts as a place where you can re-learn the basics of specific things in tkinter which will make creating a project with tkinter easier and faster
